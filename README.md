# 💻 HACKER EVOLUTION

> *"In a world where data is the new currency, only those who can read between the lines of code will survive."*

**Hacker Evolution** is a terminal-based hacking simulator, inspired by the classic *Hacker Evolution: Untold* (exosyphen studios). Explore a simulated network, scan servers, crack firewalls, steal data, and climb the leaderboard.

## 🎮 Story

You are a hacker who receives a mysterious email from **Darius**, a former CTO of **Nexus Corporation** who is now dead. His security system — *Overwatch* — has 14 days of autonomy, and it chose you as the only one who can access his legacy.

Nexus built Overwatch to protect critical infrastructure, but they weaponized it: mass surveillance, data trafficking, election manipulation, and ties to government black ops. The evidence is scattered across their servers — corporate, government, and military.

Your mission: breach Nexus's network, steal the truth, and make a final choice that will change everything.

> *"In cyberspace, no one can hear you type."*

## 👻 Ghost in the Machine — Sentinel AI

Sentinel is an adaptive adversary that reacts to your actions in real time. It's not a simple trace bar — it's a Finite State Machine that thinks.

### FSM States

```
DORMANT ──(trace > 30%)──→ ANALYZING ──(trace > 60%)──→ ACTIVE
   ↑                                                        │
   └────────────── (trace < 15% for N ticks) ───────────────┘
```

- **DORMANT** — No threat detected. Normal operations.
- **ANALYZING** — Yellow alerts. Trace signatures being scanned.
  - Random `[SENTINEL]` log messages.
- **ACTIVE** — Red alert! Countermeasures deployed:
  - 🔒 **Close ports** — Sentinel closes randomly cracked ports on your current server.
  - 🗑️ **Delete files** — Removes downloaded files from your local storage.
  - 📈 **Amplify trace** — Increases trace level by 5–15%.

### Countering Sentinel

- **KILLTRACE** — Reduces trace level, helping you slip back to DORMANT.
- **Firewall_Bypass_v1.exe** — Suppresses all Sentinel activity while active.
- **Stay stealthy** — Keep trace below 30% and Sentinel won't wake up.

> *The game becomes a chess match: predict Sentinel's moves, time your actions, and strike when it's dormant.*

## 🧠 Architecture — Refactoring Roadmap (5 Phases)

The engine was refactored in 5 phases per `update/Fase-Obiettivo-Azioniconcrete-Deliverable.csv`:

### Phase 1 — Hardening (Data Layer)
- **`engine/models.py`** — Typed dataclasses for all content: `Server`, `Mission`, `Email`, `Exploit`, `HardwareItem`, `GovernmentIntel`. Each model has `from_dict()` for JSON deserialization and `to_dict()` for serialization.
- **`engine/validation.py`** — `ContentValidator` centralizzato. Validates servers, hardware, exploits, missions, emails, gov intel at startup. Errors/warnings collected and reported without crashing.
- **`data/__init__.py`** — All `_load_json` calls now pass through the validator.
- **`data/schema/`** — JSON Schema (Draft-07) files for each content type (`mission_schema.json`, `email_schema.json`, `exploit_schema.json`, `server_schema.json`).
- **`tests/test_data.py`** — 35 unit tests covering models and validation edge cases.

### Phase 2 — Command System
- **`engine/command_registry.py`** — `CommandRegistry` singleton with `CommandMeta` (name, handler, help_text, usage, aliases, min_level, admin_only, category). Decorator-style registration and auto-generated HELP.
- Static `h_help` replaced with **dynamic HELP** generated from the registry — filtered by category, player level, and admin status.
- Commands are now registered with metadata (`_register()` calls at the bottom of `ui/commands.py`).

### Phase 3 — Domain Services
- **`engine/services/__init__.py`** — `EventBus` singleton pub/sub system with `DomainEvent` types. Decouples engine logic from UI.
- **`engine/services/economy_service.py`** — `EconomyService`: money management, purchase validation, crypto market simulation.
- **`engine/services/network_service.py`** — `NetworkService`: scan, connect, neighbor resolution, BFS reachability.
- **`engine/services/trace_service.py`** — `TraceService`: trace level management with state tracking (safe/warning/danger/critical).
- **`engine/services/mission_service.py`** — `MissionService`: mission progress checking, completion, reward dispatching.
- **`engine/services/sentinel_service.py`** — `SentinelService`: wraps the SentinelFSM for game integration with event dispatching.
- `Game.services` container provides access to all services at `g.services.economy`, `g.services.network`, etc.

### Phase 4 — FSM & Event Systems
- **`engine/sentinel.py`** — Dedicated `SentinelFSM` class with states `DORMANT → ANALYZING → ACTIVE`. Observable via domain events (`sentinel.state_changed`, `sentinel.port_closed`, `sentinel.file_deleted`, `sentinel.trace_amplified`).
- Counter-strikes: close ports, delete files, amplify trace. De-escalation when trace drops.
- `SentinelService` wraps the FSM and integrates with the game's event bus.

### Phase 5 — UX & Modding
- **JSON Schema** files in `data/schema/` — validate modded content against a formal schema (Draft-07).
- **`DEBUGSTATE`** command — shows internal state of all FSM, services, event bus, command registry, and game state at a glance.
- **`VALIDATECONTENT`** command — re-runs the ContentValidator on all JSON files at runtime. Instant feedback for modders.

## 📡 Random System Events

While you work, the terminal feels alive. Every 20–60 seconds, random system messages appear:

```
[SYSTEM] Maintenance window: 5 minutes.
[NET] Unusual traffic from IP 142.xx.xx.xx
[SEC] Firewall signature updated. 12 new rules deployed.
```

These are purely atmospheric — but they create urgency, making you feel like the network is a living, breathing entity.

## 🚀 Installation

### Requirements

- **Python 3.10+**
- **tkinter** (included with Python on Windows/macOS; on Linux: `sudo apt install python3-tk`)

### Setup

```bash
# Clone the repository

## 🧩 Creating Content (Mod System)

Full documentation: **📖 [docs/MODDING.md](docs/MODDING.md)**

The game loads all missions, emails, and exploits from individual `.json` files. **No Python code to touch.** Just drop a file in the right folder and it works.

### Quick Examples

**📜 Add a mission** — create `data/missions/my_mission.json`:

```json
{
  "id": "my_custom_mission",
  "name": "The Hidden Server",
  "lvl": 3,
  "desc": "Breach the rumored hidden server.",
  "obj_type": "download",
  "obj_file": "classified.db",
  "reward": 2500
}
```

**📧 Add an email** — create `data/emails/my_email.json`:

```json
{
  "sub": "A Friendly Warning",
  "lvl": 4,
  "body": "Nexus deployed new IDS systems.\nUpgrade your firewall.\n— Darius"
}
```

**🕶️ Add a Darknet exploit** — add an entry to `data/exploits.json`:

```json
{
  "id": "my_radar",
  "name": "Radar_Scan_v2.exe",
  "desc": "Reveals all entry points on the network",
  "cost": 1500,
  "level": 2,
  "type": "tool",
  "effect": "global_reveal",
  "content": "# Radar_Scan_v2 — network radar scan"
}
```

### 🧪 Validation

The game **will not crash** if a JSON file has a syntax error. You'll see a friendly warning in the terminal:

```
[ERROR] Data file 'my_mission.json' in data/missions/ is corrupt. Skipping.
```

Fix the file and restart the game.

### 🤝 How to Contribute

1. Fork the repository
2. Add your `.json` file(s) to the appropriate folder
3. Test by running the game locally
4. Submit a Pull Request

Your mission, email, or exploit could be part of the official game!
